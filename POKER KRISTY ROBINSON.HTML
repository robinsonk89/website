      <p style="color:rgb(250, 250, 250);">In Texas hold'em, each player is dealt two private cards (known as 'hole cards') that belong to them alone. Five community cards are then dealt face-up on the 'board'. All players in the game use these shared community cards in conjunction with their own hole cards to each make their best possible five-card poker hand. In Texas hold'em, a player may use any combination of the seven cards available to them to make the best possible five-card hand. The player can use both hole cards, one hole card, or even no hole cards (play the board) to make their hand.</p>
<br>
<p style="color:rgb(250, 250, 250);">The dealing process in Texas hold'em is quite systematic. The two players to the left of the dealer put out blind bets. The player directly to the dealer's left puts out the small blind, and the player two to the dealer's left puts out the big blind, which is typically twice the size of the small blind. The dealer then deals two cards to each player, starting with the player to their left and continuing clockwise. After the hole cards are dealt, the first betting round begins with the player sitting immediately to the left of the big blind. This player can either fold, call the big blind, or raise.</p>
 <br>       
<p style="color:rgb(250, 250, 250);">After the first betting round, the dealer discards the top card of the deck. This is called the 'burn card' and is done to ensure that no one accidentally saw the top card, and to help prevent cheating. The dealer then flips the next three cards face up on the table. This is called the 'flop'. Another round of betting ensues, starting with the first player to the left of the dealer that is still in the hand.</p>
   <br>     
   <p style="color:rgb(250, 250, 250);">Once the betting for the flop is completed, the dealer burns another card and then deals one more card face up on the board. This is known as the 'turn'. Another round of betting occurs, starting again with the first player to the left of the dealer that is still in the hand. After the betting for the turn is completed, the dealer burns a final card and places a final card face up on the board. This is called the 'river'. The final round of betting occurs, starting with the first player to the left of the dealer that is still in the hand.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="color:rgb(250, 250, 250);">If two or more players are still in the hand after the final betting round, a showdown occurs. The player who bet on the river is the first to show their hand. If no betting happened on the river, the player closest to the left of the dealer shows their hand first. Players reveal their hands in clockwise order. The player with the highest-ranking hand wins the pot. In the case of identical hands, the pot will be equally divided between the players with the best hands.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="color:rgb(250, 250, 250);"> Texas hold'em betting works in a series of rounds. Each round has a limit on the minimum and maximum bets, and these limits typically increase as the game progresses. Betting in Texas hold'em is done in a clockwise direction, and players have the option to 'call', 'raise', or 'fold' when it's their turn to bet. To 'call' is to match the amount of the previous bet. To 'raise' is to not only match the previous bet, but to also increase it. To 'fold' is to give up on the hand and any potential claim on the pot.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="color:rgb(250, 250, 250);">Understanding these rules is crucial for anyone looking to become proficient in Texas hold'em poker. Mastery of the game mechanics, along with strategic play and the ability to read other players, forms the foundation of becoming a successful Texas hold'em player. Remember, practice is key, and the more you play, the more familiar you will become with the nuances of the game.</p>
